This repository contains modular implementations of the storage and retrieval market subsystems of Filecoin. These modules are guided by the [v1.0 and 1.1 Filecoin specification updates](https://filecoin-project.github.io/specs/#intro__changelog). 

Separating an implementation into a blockchain component and one or more mining and market components presents an opportunity to encourage implementation diversity while re-using non-security-critical components, and also greatly ease miner-operator customisations.

## Components
